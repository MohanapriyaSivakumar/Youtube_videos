After Mr. Cotton's departure Mr. John Sullivan, an officer of long revenue experience, was employed to prosecute the inquiry left incomplete by the former gentleman, and he made separate reports on several districts. In his report on Coimbatore the following passages occur, in which Mr. Sullivan states, in strong terms, his opinion of the importance of giving more attention to the improvement of irrigation works, and urges various arguments and proofs in support of that opinion :-</br>&quot;3.	*	*	*	*	*	*	*</br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------(50)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>&quot;The degree in which lands watered from the

,' a very trifling decrease only in the revenue dependent upon the ' Umrawatty,' and an immense defalcation from the lands of every other description. With this incontestable proof that the prosperity of the revenue of Coimbatore depends entirely upon the degree in which the district can be brought within the influence of artificial irrigation, it is very extraordinary to hear an opinion from the acting principal collector that it would neither be for the interest of the government nor the people that any considerable expense should be incurred in improving or extending the works of irrigation. His reasons are, that, as regards the ryots, a considerable extension of cultivation would, by reducing the prices, be detrimental to the interests of those who did not share in it; and with respect to those who have the means and inclination to extend their cultivation, there appears to be quite sufficient waste land in the district, both wet and dry, which they may bring into cultivation without government incurring any expense to enable them to do so.</br>&quot; 5. For nine out of ten years this fine district has been reduced to a state of extreme misery, simply because the usual supplies of water for the cultivation of the land have been withheld ; wherever these supplies have been furnished, the country is in a flourishing state, the revenue of government is steadily increasing, the value of land is enhanced, and there is a total absence of that misery which prevails in every other part of the district ; and yet the collector thinks it would be better to risk the periodical return of this misery, than to do anything that might hurt the interests of the favoured few who thrive upon famine prices, while the bulk of the people are in jeopardy for food.</br>&quot; 6. The collector shows that there has been a steady increase in the prices of the principal articles of agricultural produce since the first cession of the produce to the British government, and that the rise of price during the last 12 years is to be attributed to deficiency of produce from bad seasons. Comparing</br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------(51)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>the prices of paddy which prevailed in 1802, when the survey assessment was introduced, and in the five succeeding years, with the prices of the last eight years, there is an increase of upwards of 20 per cent. upon the average in the last period, notwithstanding the very large increase that has been made in the interval to this species of produce, in consequence of improved irrigation. In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7. He seems to forget that, at all events, population is likely to keep pace with increase of produce ; that the produce, therefore, of Coimbatore might be made as large and certain as that of Tanjore, without any permanent effect being produced upon prices, famine prices being left out of consideration.</br>&quot; 8. Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable. When the people of Coimbatore are starving, the people of Malabar to the west, and the people of Tanjore to the east, have abundance, simply because their lands are well watered.</br>&quot; 9. The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11. The records will show that there is not a single district, Canara and Tanjore excepted, in which a failure of crops to a certain extent does not occur every year. The people of the northern districts have suffered severe privations for several successive years. In Ganjarn, scarcity prevails at this moment; and yet in that and in other districts,

In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7.

Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable.

The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11.

In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7. He seems to forget that, at all events, population is likely to keep pace with increase of produce ; that the produce, therefore, of Coimbatore might be made as large and certain as that of Tanjore, without any permanent effect being produced upon prices, famine prices being left out of consideration.</br>&quot; 8. Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable.

The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11. The records will show that there is not a single district, Canara and Tanjore excepted, in which a failure of crops to a certain extent does not occur every year.

This is an increase of more than fivefold to the revenue, and of more than double that amount to the proprietor.&quot;</br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------(51)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>the prices of paddy which prevailed in 1802, when the survey assessment was introduced, and in the five succeeding years, with the prices of the last eight years, there is an increase of upwards of 20 per cent. upon the average in the last period, notwithstanding the very large increase that has been made in the interval to this species of produce, in consequence of improved irrigation. In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7. He seems to forget that, at all events, population is likely to keep pace with increase of produce ; that the produce, therefore, of Coimbatore might be made as large and certain as that of Tanjore, without any permanent effect being produced upon prices, famine prices being left out of consideration.</br>&quot; 8. Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable. When the people of Coimbatore are starving, the people of Malabar to the west, and the people of Tanjore to the east, have abundance, simply because their lands are well watered.</br>&quot; 9. The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11. The records will show that there is not a single district, Canara and Tanjore excepted, in which a failure of crops to a certain extent does not occur every year.

This is an increase of more than fivefold to the revenue, and of more than double that amount to the proprietor.&quot;</br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------(51)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>the prices of paddy which prevailed in 1802, when the survey assessment was introduced, and in the five succeeding years, with the prices of the last eight years, there is an increase of upwards of 20 per cent. upon the average in the last period, notwithstanding the very large increase that has been made in the interval to this species of produce, in consequence of improved irrigation. In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7. He seems to forget that, at all events, population is likely to keep pace with increase of produce ; that the produce, therefore, of Coimbatore might be made as large and certain as that of Tanjore, without any permanent effect being produced upon prices, famine prices being left out of consideration.</br>&quot; 8. Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable. When the people of Coimbatore are starving, the people of Malabar to the west, and the people of Tanjore to the east, have abundance, simply because their lands are well watered.</br>&quot; 9. The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11. The records will show that there is not a single district, Canara and Tanjore excepted, in which a failure of crops to a certain extent does not occur every year.

This is an increase of more than fivefold to the revenue, and of more than double that amount to the proprietor.&quot;</br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------(51)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>the prices of paddy which prevailed in 1802, when the survey assessment was introduced, and in the five succeeding years, with the prices of the last eight years, there is an increase of upwards of 20 per cent. upon the average in the last period, notwithstanding the very large increase that has been made in the interval to this species of produce, in consequence of improved irrigation. In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7. He seems to forget that, at all events, population is likely to keep pace with increase of produce ; that the produce, therefore, of Coimbatore might be made as large and certain as that of Tanjore, without any permanent effect being produced upon prices, famine prices being left out of consideration.</br>&quot; 8. Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable. When the people of Coimbatore are starving, the people of Malabar to the west, and the people of Tanjore to the east, have abundance, simply because their lands are well watered.</br>&quot; 9. The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11. The records will show that there is not a single district, Canara and Tanjore excepted, in which a failure of crops to a certain extent does not occur every year. The people of the northern districts have suffered severe privations for several successive years. In Ganjarn, scarcity prevails at this moment; and yet in that and in other districts,

In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7.

Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable. When the people of Coimbatore are starving, the people of Malabar to the west, and the people of Tanjore to the east, have abundance, simply because their lands are well watered.</br>&quot; 9. The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11. The records will show that there is not a single district, Canara and Tanjore excepted, in which a failure of crops to a certain extent does not occur every year.

This is an increase of more than fivefold to the revenue, and of more than double that amount to the proprietor.&quot;</br>282. After Mr. Cotton's departure Mr. John Sullivan, an officer of long revenue experience, was employed to prosecute the inquiry left incomplete by the former gentleman, and he made separate reports on several districts. In his report on Coimbatore the following passages occur, in which Mr. Sullivan states, in strong terms, his opinion of the importance of giving more attention to the improvement of irrigation works, and urges various arguments and proofs in support of that opinion :-</br>&quot;3.	*	*	*	*	*	*	*</br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------(51)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>the prices of paddy which prevailed in 1802, when the survey assessment was introduced, and in the five succeeding years, with the prices of the last eight years, there is an increase of upwards of 20 per cent. upon the average in the last period, notwithstanding the very large increase that has been made in the interval to this species of produce, in consequence of improved irrigation. In some of the latter years, famine prices have prevailed; the produce of the country has been quite insufficient for the population ; and yet the collector doubts whether any attempt should be made to increase the quantity of food.</br>&quot; 7. He seems to forget that, at all events, population is likely to keep pace with increase of produce ; that the produce, therefore, of Coimbatore might be made as large and certain as that of Tanjore, without any permanent effect being produced upon prices, famine prices being left out of consideration.</br>&quot; 8. Every fourth or fifth year the government loses a large revenue, the people suffer from a scarcity of food, and the cattle perish for want of water ; if we are to do nothing to supply this want, it is evident that these evils are irremediable. When the people of Coimbatore are starving, the people of Malabar to the west, and the people of Tanjore to the east, have abundance, simply because their lands are well watered.</br>&quot; 9. The collector appears to forget that the waste land, wet and dry, which he speaks of as available for cultivation, cannot be cultivated without water ; the more certain the supply of water the better the cultivation, but no supply can be certain that depends upon the falling rains. When dry land is converted into wet, the produce is increased fivefold; if the supply of water be never failing, this increase is certain, and the revenue of government increases in nearly an equal proportion.</br>&quot;10. It is quite clear, therefore, that instead of standing still, the government should never relax their efforts until they have succeeded in turning upon the land all the water that is now permitted to run waste to the sea. When all has been done that can be done in this way, by far the largest portion of all the districts, Tanjore alone excepted, will remain dependent upon the monsoon rains for its produce, liable therefore, or rather sure to be visited periodically with scarcity, and not certain in any one year of yielding a full harvest.</br>&quot;11. The records will show that there is not a single district, Canara and Tanjore excepted, in which a failure of crops to a certain extent does not occur every year. The people of the northern districts have suffered severe privations for several successive years. In Ganjarn, scarcity prevails at this moment; and yet in that and in other districts,

No one who reads these details can hesitate, I imagine, as to the expediency of expending money upon the improvement of the irrigation of this district ; it is by such expenditure alone indeed, judiciously made, that we can hope to see it restored to its former prosperous state. The means of making this improvement is obvious : viz., the formation of reservoirs in the most favourable positions for storing the surplus waters of the

Referring to what I have said of the advantage to be derived from a judicious expenditure upon works of irrigation, I beg to enclose a statement which has just reached me from the principal collector, and which shows that from Fusly 1209 up to Fusly 1249, a period of 40 years, the sum expended in improving and extending the works dependent upon the '
